\chapter{Personal Reflections}

Regarding the following project InforMe@Dublin, the developer has expressed Great enjoyment on creating an application of the following standard. The application was a joy on completing which allowed the developer to show the skills on which he has learnt over the past four years studying computer science at the Institute of Technology Blanchardstown. Regarding the skills needed for completing such an app of a high standard and the progressing to the release of an app which is the only one of its kind located in the Google play store. Some problems faced throughout the development of such an application where the concurrency issues of which related to the accessing of the Firebase database and populating the monument fields, Geofence locations and data on which other users have added. Some of these methods on which needed access to the database of which had to be slowed down on processing the data within the app. It was fun creating an app from scratch seeing a theory in the developers head into becoming a fully functional Android application. The developer would like to update the app into the distant future continually and updating the geofences of different area's but also to include a website on which geofence's can be added and updated as well as uploading the associated images.

\section{Fingal County Council Feedback}
Concerning sending the InforMe@Dublin application to Fingal county council, the developer received some feedback which was good news. The person who is an editor and project manager of Dublin.ie thought that the application was quite good considering it's a student project. On first installing the application the user had a problem with signing into the app which was a weird error considering the installation was tested on a few devices. Anthony Mc Guinness wished the developer all the best of luck on developing the InforMe@Dublin Android Application.

\section{Dublin City County Council Feedback}
Regarding receiving feedback from Dublin City Council, the developer was directed to the Mobile Device section, of which was notified of the application due to a contract that is between the council and their work mobiles they cannot install unknown applications. Because this application doesn't have enough recognition with regards to known security risk factors they cannot download these unknown applications even though the application is on the Google Play Store and passed all security screening. While the application uses the mobile's location and access to photographs and media files, it cannot be installed on their device hence forfeiting a contract of which they have made with the mobile provider.
