The project in hand takes on the role of a software developer which is a computer science student at the Institute of Technology Blanchardstown. The proposer of the project puts into focus, that historical monuments which are located throughout the suburb's and city of Dublin have been neglected over some time on which the developer wishes to change. Bringing the past and present together as one is what the application is trying to achieve as well as educating local people about their area.
\par
The proposer of the project is willing to design and implement a location-aware Android application which provides Geofence locations of specific historical monuments. On entering such a monument, the Information will then be presented to the user of such device. The language of which the app would be coded will be Java on which the developer has learned over numerous years.
\par
The following application would provide an inexpensive way of displaying historical information to patrons of the app and other tourists of which wish to learn about Dublin. The application could change the way locals and tourists learn about the surrounding area of Dublin. The developer will contact Dublin county council and Fingal county council to receive their feedback or funding for the rollout of such an application to the general public.
